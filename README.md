## Streamlit app for Costa-Rica household poverty level prediction

- I previously published a Python package for a data pipeline that performs data cleaning, feature engineering and selection, and modeling using data on Costa Rican households characterisitcs.
- This web-app will accquire household characterisitics data from the user and use the trained pipeline to make household poverty predictions (the trained data pipeline is installed as a dependency for this app).
- I also display the feature importance from the model, and several of its evaluation metrics in a streamlit app.
