## Streamlit app for Costa-Rica household poverty level prediction

- I previously published a Python package for a data pipeline that performs data cleaning, feature engineering and selection, and modeling using data on Costa Rican households characteristics. The link to the project can be found [here](https://github.com/hfung4/Data-Projects/tree/master/costa_rican_poverty_classifier).
- This web-app will accquire household characterisitics data from the user and use the trained pipeline to make household poverty predictions (the trained data pipeline is installed as a dependency for this app).
- I also display the feature importance from the model, and several of its evaluation metrics in a streamlit app.



**The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud and can be access via this [link](https://hfung4-costa-rica-poverty-webapp-main-5zkvam.streamlit.app/).**
